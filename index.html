<h1>The Story in the Book </h1>
<h1>Chapter 1</h1> 
<p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now.
     On her desk, lying bedtween the copies of <cite>Nature,
         New Scientist,</cite>  and all the other scientific generals
          her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>
             On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favourite book 
             since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls
              the more he felt she needed to be free.</p>
<p>she had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under this 
    poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the
         refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although
          many cosiderd her pioneering work, unravelling the secrets
           of Ilama DNA, to be an outstanding acievement, Molly 
           <em>did</em> think she had something better to do
